# bios815
Repository for BIOSTAT 815 WN 2021.

## Introduction
This repository contains all the relevant files for the final term project. A note on the organisation of this repository. 

The [\code](https://github.com/soumikp/bios815/tree/main/code) directory contains two files:

1. `permutation_test.R` has the code by which we obtain p-values for the individual distance-based tests as well as the omnibus test. 
2. `analysis.R` has the code which is used to analyse the gut microbiome data presented in [Zhang et al. (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/11/1875/4810437)

The [\data](https://github.com/soumikp/bios815/tree/main/data) directory contains files associated with gut microbiome data which we analyse in this report.
