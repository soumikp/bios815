The [code]{https://github.com/soumikp/bios815/tree/main/code} directory contains two files:

1. `permutation_test.R` has the code by which we obtain p-values for the individual distance-based tests as well as the omnibus test. 
2. `analysis.R` has the code which is used to analyse the gut microbiome data presented in [Zhang et al. (2018)]{}
